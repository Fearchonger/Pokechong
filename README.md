This is Pokechong, a terminal-based Pokemon clone that I submitted for my high school APSCP project.
I'm quite proud of the work I've done, as I was motivated enough to continue adding more content after submitting,
which gave me much of the knowledge of functions and classes that I have today.
For the sake of retaining my high school innocence, I have uploaded the code without any major edits or fixes since graduation.
Hope you enjoy!
