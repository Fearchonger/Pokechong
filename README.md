<h1 align="center">Pokéchong</h1>

This is Pokéchong, a terminal-based Pokémon clone that I submitted for my high school APSCP project.
I'm quite proud of the work I've done, as I was motivated enough to continue adding more content after submitting,
which gave me much of the knowledge of functions and classes that I have today.
For the sake of retaining my high school innocence, I have uploaded the code without any major edits or fixes since graduation (hence the terrible Pokéchong names).
Hope you enjoy!
